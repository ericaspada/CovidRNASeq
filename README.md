# CovidRNASeq
This dataset consists of RNA-sequencing data from 484 covid-19 positive and negative patients. In addition to gene expression values, the dataset also contains patient age, gender, and viral load measurement. The goal of this exploration is to identify differentially expressed genes between positive and negative patients and also see if there are differences across patient sub-groups
